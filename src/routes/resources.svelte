    <p>
        Here you'll find all kinds of stuff about me. Things I use, people I
        follow, books I read, shows I watch... and much more.
        <br />
        <br />
        I also include some short description/reason why I like the thing. Where
        appropriate, I also include links to some examples of my favorite pieces
        of the work.

                        of doing projects. Unforutnately dissapeared for several
                        years, came back with one video in 2023 and then
                        vanished again.

                        An engineer evolved into comedian. Funniest short
                        sketches that never dissapoint. Never did I think a
                        video about US health care would make me laugh so hard.

                        consumption. More of a story-telling documentaries with

                        unique projects and share them with the world.

                    The most imaginative science fiction I ever came across.
                    Basically all the sci-fi concepts can be found inside this

                    My favorite band of all time, I know all the song, even
                    before Tyler and Josh got together. The range of genres they
                    cover is wide, the lyrics is deep and the world-building
                    behind the scenes makes a lot of sense and I can relate to
                    it on a personal level. You never know what comes next, you
                    only know you'll love it whether it's pop, alternative rock,
                    rap or anything else.

                <p>
                    Runner-up for my favorite band. A very unknown band, I even
                    reached 0.001% of their listeners on Spotify. Their songs
                    made me vibe during hard early times I spent in the
                    Netherlands. They are similar to early Twenty One Pilots.

                    Brother of the lead singer from Twenty One Pilots. He's also
                    pretty new to the industry, but his alternative hip-hop
                    songs already feel very professional.

                    A pop band with unique songs and even more unique

                    Three brothers (Adam, Jack and Ryan) whose songs I'd compare
                    to half•alive. Their songs don't sound as unique in my
                    opinion, but they are still very good.

                <p>
                    Amazing film music that I listen to while studying. The best
                    two soundtracks in my opinion are Interstellar and Dune,
                    which both create a very unique atmosphere for the movies
                    and are a wonder to listen to.

                    The science fiction masterpiece packed with humour. It deals
                    with all the sci-fi tropes and at the same time makes fun of
                    them. In a way similar to Three Body Problem.

                    short, lovely and uplifting. Looking forward to season 2 too

                    storytelling along with the Hans Zimmer soundtrack creates a
                    vivid experience. I was craving water while watching the

                    what I need more of.

                <p>
                    One of the best investments I've ever done. Takes about two
                    days to get used to, but once you do it's a pleasure to work
                    with. My wrist never hurts and I also learned to play games
                    using this mouse. Yes, even CS:GO.

                    I thought I'd NEVER buy an e-reader because I love the feel
                    of books. However when I moved to the Netherlands I had no
                    choice if I wanted to read books in Czech. And I found out
                    that the e-ink screen makes reading a pleasurable experience
                    nevertheless.

                    The best headphones I ever owned. When they break, I am
                    definitely going for another one made by Audio-Technica, as
                    the sound quality is amazing. They also feel natural on the
                    head and I've never had a single problem with them.
